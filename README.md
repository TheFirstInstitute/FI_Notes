# FI_Notes
XML database for notes of the First Institute
\n This is a knowledge sharing and reformatting project. 
\n We are trying to convert every written note into XML format, in order to get a better result in searching, analysis and recalling.
\n We believe it is sort of the start of a new era of modern education.
